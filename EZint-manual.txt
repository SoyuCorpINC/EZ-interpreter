Thank you for using SoyuCorpINC :)

what you are reading right now is a short manual on how to use
the EZ programming language interpreter.

firstly, like any python program, you gotta double click on it to start it.
after you've done that, the program should provide you with an input function.
In this input function you have to put the filename of your EZ program with a .txt at the end of it.

Lucky for you there is a basic program already given within the project.

just type the name of this file with a .txt at the end.

this should run the program written in it.
to learn the basics of EZ you can use this test program
as a starting point.
the only thing it doesnt contain it the cut() function, which is still in developement.
currently the cut() function can only be used on its own.

EZ has a limited variable system for now, which will be fixed soon.

currently the only variable useable for if statements are x,y, and z.
for stand alone variables currently you can only use x,y,z,a,b, and c.
